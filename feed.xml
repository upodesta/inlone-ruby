      <description>The current fiscal regime of Bangladesh consists of direct and indirect taxation. It is governed by the
National Board of Revenue (NBR). Revenue is also generated from non-NBR sectors and under the laws
and acts of related ministries. The NBR taxes include Customs Duty, Value Added Tax (VAT),
Supplementary Duty (SD), Personal Income Taxes (PIT) and Corporate Income Taxes (CIT).
Personal and Corporate Income Tax, the single largest source of direct tax, is governed by the Income
Tax Ordinance, 1984 (XXXVI of 1984). The income tax laws consist of the following statutes (apart from
the main statute):

      <link>https://diary.hassanandassociates.biz/legal-system-of-bangladesh/</link>
      <description>Bangladesh is a common law based jurisdiction. Many of the basic laws of Bangladesh such as penal code, civil and criminal procedural codes, contract law and company law are influenced by English common laws. However family laws such as laws relating to marriage, dissolution of marriage and inheritance are based on religious scripts, and therefore differ between religious communities. The Bangladeshi legal system is based on a written constitution and the laws often take statutory forms which are enacted by the legislature and interpreted by the higher courts. Ordinarily executive authorities and statutory corporations cannot make any law, but can make by-laws to the extent authorized by the legislature. Such subordinate legislation is known as rules or regulations and is also enforceable by the court. Yet being a common law system, the statutes are short, and set out basic rights and responsibilities but are elaborated by the courts in their application and interpretation of those. In addition, certain customs and practices established over a period are also to some extent recognized as acceptable and are enforced by the courts.

      <description>The major reform of tax administration occurred in the 1990s, in
a democratic regime following military rule in the country. However, there is no study to measure the
effect of democratic environment on the revenue administration and governance. Indirect taxes are still the primary source of government income and contribute the lion’s
share of total tax receipts in Bangladesh. The administration of direct taxes is outdated and based on territorial and geographical administrative
units. As long as withholding taxes at sources has no central database, there is no way for the tax
administration to follow up on additional tax payments and also administer the withholding agencies.
The combined effect of all these deficiencies is the very low tax efficiency and the very low direct tax to
GDP ratio in Bangladesh. Given the context the main recommendations are:

      <description>There have been some policy discussions about the tax law in Bangladesh, although not very effective.
The income tax legislation dates to the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, and was promulgated under the
military rule. According to the 1984 Ordinance there are seven forms of income on which tax is levied:
salaries, interest on securities, income from house or property, agricultural income, income from
business or profession, capital gains and income from other sources (Income Tax Manual Part-1, 2019). A number of efforts were made to strengthen the revenue mobilization and improve the tax structure.
In 1991 Bangladesh embarked on a major tax reform through the introduction of the VAT system.
Simultaneously there was a significant reduction of import tariffs. Prior to these reforms, trade-based
taxes dominated the tax structure in Bangladesh with customs duties alone accounting for about a third
of tax revenue during the first two decades of the country’s independence.

      <description>In Bangladesh, the winding up of a company may be either – (1) Voluntary; or (2) By the court; or (3) Subject to the supervision of the court. Voluntary winding up is usually undertaken by solvent companies, except in the case of creditor’s voluntary winding up. Now we have described the process of voluntary winding up by passing a special resolution.

      <link>https://diary.hassanandassociates.biz/what-is-arbitration/</link>
      <description> The essence of arbitration is that it is an agreement between two or more parties to try to resolve a dispute outside of the court system. The parties agree upon a third party as an arbitrator who will act as a judge and jury. After giving the parties the opportunity to present their side of the story and to present any relevant documents or other evidence, the arbitrator will act as King Solomon to decide who wins and who loses. 
There are usually no set rules as to how arbitration is conducted. It is typically left to the agreement of the parties. To facilitate the process, though, the parties will oftentimes agree to use the rules of an established organization like the American Arbitration Association. 
There can be binding and non-binding arbitration. A “binding” arbitration generally means that the winning party can take an arbitration award to a court of law and enforce it if the losing party does not comply with the terms of the decision. 
“Non-binding” arbitration refers to a situation where the parties agree to use arbitration as a forum to try to resolve their differences, but neither party is bound to comply with any decision by the arbitrator.

      <description>For a return submitted under normal scheme, assessment is made after giving an opportunity of hearing.
For  returns  submitted  under  Universal  Self  Assessment  Scheme, the  acknowledgement  slip  is considered to be an assessment order of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxes. Universal Self Assessment may be subject to “process and audit”.

      <description>Double Taxation is created when the same income is taxed in two different countres during international trade. Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements is an agreement concluded between Bangladesh and another jurisdiction (a treaty partner) which serves to relieve double taxation of income that is earned in one jurisdiction by a resident of the other jurisdiction. It spells out the taxing rights between Bangladesh and her treaty partner on the different types of income arising from cross-border economic activities between the two jurisdictions. It also provides for reduction or exemption of tax on certain types of income.
