title: Copyright Registration in Bangladesh  
---

Copyright is the exclusive right given to the creator of a creative work to reproduce the work, usually for a limited time. The creative work may be in a literary, artistic, educational, or musical form. Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself. Under copyright law, a work is considered original if the author created it from independent thinking void of duplication. This type of work is known as Original Work of Authorship (OWA). Anyone with an original work of authorship automatically has the copyright to that work, preventing anyone else from using or replicating it. The copyright can be registered voluntarily by the original owner if he or she would like to get an upper hand in the legal system if the need arises. In Bangladesh, Copyright Office is responsible maintaining the register of copyrighted works. Any application for registration, transfer, abandonment, modification of register should be made to the Registrar.

## REGISTRATION

- A completed application form

- Treasury chalan

- Copies of the work to be registered

- Transfer deed of work in stamp paper (if applicable)

- Legal paper (Okalat nama) (if a lawyer submits the application form on behalf of the author)

Once the Registrar received any application for copyright, s/he shall serve notice of the concerned application to every person who has any interest in the subject matter of that application. If the Registrar receives any objection s/he may after holding such inquiry as s/he deems fit, enter such particulars of work in the register of copyright, which s/he considers proper.

After registration, the Registrar shall sends copies of the entries made in the register to the parties concerned.
