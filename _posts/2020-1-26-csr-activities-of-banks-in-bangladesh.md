title: CSR Activities of Banks in Bangladesh
---

![csr](/images/logos/csr.jpg "csr") Historically, the banking sector of Bangladesh has been amply participating in various social activities especially, in the areas of education, health, sports, benevolent activities like donations to different charitable organizations, to poor people and religious institutions, city beautification and patronizing art & culture, etc. Bangladesh Bank issued a comprehensive circular titled ‘Mainstreaming  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  (CSR)  in banks  and financial institutions in Bangladesh’. 

In that circular, CSR was defined as 

(i) considering the economic, social and environmental   consequences   of   a   business,   

(ii) mitigating the negative impacts and bolstering the benign effects, (iii) initiating action programs and community investments to trim down social exclusion and inequality  as well  as to address  the core sustainable  development  challenges (fulfilling  the  requirements  of  the  current  generation  without  cramping  the capacity of future generations is a generally agreed meaning of ‘sustainable development’).

BB has been motivating  banks to expand lending  to the under-served  sectors both as business case and CSR obligation; expecting to lead to more broad-based inclusive growth, and therefore reduce poverty. BB has indicated some priority areas  in the field  of CSR  like Self-employment  and SME  credits  designed  to create  productive   new  on-farm/off-farm   employment;   Financing   of  biomass processing  plants,  solar  panels,  waste  recycling  plants,  Effluent  Treatment Plants  (ETPs);  Credit  programs  for  diversified  production  of  crops,  oilseeds, spices, vegetables, fruits etc.; Mobile phone based/MFI supported programs for prompt  delivery  of  remittances;  card  based/  mobile  phone  based  delivery  of financial services; Financing programs to promote domestic tourism and markets in cultural products/events

Bangladesh Bank has, of course, started guiding the banking sector to become more environmentally responsive (e.g. via refinancing new loan products on solar energy, bio-gas, effluent treatment plant etc). All the commercial banks are asked to formulate their own CSR policy with the annual outlay for CSR programs and include  the  CSR  programs  in  their  mainstream  banking  activities  instead  of short-term social works like providing grants, aids and donations. In December
2010, Bangladesh Bank instructed the banks to establish separate CSR desk to
pay special attention on this issue.

Reporting of the CSR initiatives by banks was suggested as appendage to regular annual financial reports, ultimately to build up full length wide-ranging reports in the Green Reporting  Initiatives  (GRI) format. Alike the statutory  financial reports, the CSR reports were also anticipated to be publicly available for stakeholders’ perusal.

Bangladesh Bank has been publishing CSR review report annually for tracing advancement  in  mainstreaming  of  CSR  activities.  CSR  initiatives  of  banks during last five years continued focus on i) financial inclusion of less privileged population segments and underserved  economic sectors, ii) emergency relief in humanitarian distresses, ii) promotion of health, education and cultural/recreational  activities  for  advancement  and  well  being  of underprivileged  population  segments,  iii)  financing  and  promotion  of environment friendly projects, iv) adoption of energy efficient, carbon footprint reducing internal processes and practices in own offices and establishments.

Besides CSR initiatives involving direct expenditure, financial inclusion initiatives of banks proceeded apace during last five years. All banks participated actively in promotion of lending to SMEs and agricultural. For broader, deeper financial inclusion, banks proceeded ahead on multiple fronts including increased rural bank branch presence,  mobile phone banking,  and opening  of bank accounts for low income population free of charge with nominal Taka 10 initial deposit

Globally, banks pursue CSR practices from self initiative. Central bank usually doesn't intervene in their CSR activities or provide any directives to motivate banks for participating in CSR activities. But, in case of Bangladesh, the central bank provided regulatory framework to banks for CSR activities and monitors that in a regular fashion.

Bangladesh Bank is one of the members of United Nations Global Compact(UNGC) concentrating  in  the  areas  of  human  rights,  labor  standards,  the  environment  and  anti- corruption.

Bangladesh Bank being the chair of the Steering Committee of UNGC Bangladesh Local Network is actively leading CSR issues and implementation  of CSR activities in financial sector as well as facilitates social investments in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh Bank in association with CSR Centre, Bangladesh playing a major role in different programs involving social, economic and environmental aspects.

As Bangladesh is a developing country, both central bank and revenue collector of government  have to take proactive steps for fostering growth and economic development.  Moreover, in a country like Bangladesh, poverty alleviation through minimizing income disparity is one of the top priorities. In that context, BB  devises  supervisory  policies  in  such  a manner,  especially  for  last  several years, so that banks not only move forward for their own growth, but also cansupport the development initiatives of the government. On the other hand, NBR too has provided tax incentive on CSR activities aimed towards motivating sustainable development activities.

Since the issuance of CSR directive by BB and SRO on after tax incentive from NBR, the involvement of banks in CSR activities has augmented in many folded aspects. Banks' rapidly increasing participation in CSR activities with incorporation of socially and environmentally accountable   organizational objectives,   strategies   and  operations   that  are  swiftly   turning   into   global standards   in   “socially   responsible   competition”   towards   rearing   inclusive economic and social growth and facilitate the nation to go forward with desired growth and efficient allocation of resources. Surely the collaborative effort by the concerned government bodies will further increase the CSR activities by banks which will support sustainable development drive of the Government of Peoples' Republic of Bangladesh.
