title:  Major Policy Reforms and their Impact  
---

There have been some policy discussions about the tax law in Bangladesh, although not very effective.
The income tax legislation dates to the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, and was promulgated under the
military rule. According to the 1984 Ordinance there are seven forms of income on which tax is levied:
salaries, interest on securities, income from house or property, agricultural income, income from
business or profession, capital gains and income from other sources (Income Tax Manual Part-1, 2019). A number of efforts were made to strengthen the revenue mobilization and improve the tax structure.

In 1991 Bangladesh embarked on a major tax reform through the introduction of the VAT system.
Simultaneously there was a significant reduction of import tariffs. Prior to these reforms, trade-based
taxes dominated the tax structure in Bangladesh with customs duties alone accounting for about a third
of tax revenue during the first two decades of the country’s independence.

Following the introduction of VAT in 1991, the share of VAT revenue increased substantially to reach
29% in 2014, while the share of customs duties declined to 10.8%. Even though the base of the VAT
system has been expanded, numerous distortions were also introduced for reasons of political
expediency. Because of these problems, the VAT system underperformed considerably in terms of
revenue generation compared with its potential. It is evident that a narrow tax-base, widespread
exemptions and administrative inefficiencies are the main factors behind the low tax-to-GDP ratio in
Bangladesh compared to the neighbouring countries. This also implies that the tax reforms of the last
decades did not bring about significant changes in Bangladesh’s tax efficiency

In recent years much simplification and rationalization has been introduced to reform the taxation
system. Tax assessments were made less complicated and an attempt of attracting more taxpayers into
the tax net was made. The automation of tax collection was begun, and compliance with the standards
and systems introduced by WCO has increased. The practice of honouring the taxpayers and recognizing
their contribution received institutional shape in the NBR. In the case of legislative reforms, the new
Value Added Tax and Supplementary Duty Act of 2012 were enacted and effective from July 2016.

A draft Direct Tax Code was posted on the government’s website and steps will be taken to get it
passed by Parliament by next year. There are plans for a comprehensive /maximum reduction in the rate
of Import and Supplementary Duty in the budget, which is eventually shift the burden of revenue collection to Individual and Corporate Tax along with Value Added Tax (VAT)
